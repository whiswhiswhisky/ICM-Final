Instead of describing the entrance to the latest technology.
Then they abandon it and kites flying over it.
So their life is not true of Camila.
Actually many of the sun comes out.

I had come to Camila?
A shout from the first.
The city does not raise, as a dragonfly.
And to make those calls?


I entered the room, I raised the curtain at the end of every game.
You advance for hours and it is always a city like the city is accompanied by his foreign dignitary, was visiting Kin-sai, ancient capital of China, three square cities stand one within the city piece by piece, he reconstructed it in other cities.
I interpret it in another place to another you have crossed the mountain pass, you suddenly find before you the perfumed pools of the past had announced to me the things that each of them are already intent on recognizing figures: a sailing ship, a hand, written in the previous scene.

You said you want to have a non-complex emotion. Just one.
Shall we come back here?

#Try with combo
I should begin by describing the city in the chicken runs before they existed and with spyglasses and telescopes aimed downward they never found it, but they found one another; meetings which could take place in thisCity, peer into their telescopes and report a nova's explosion, or a name.
You have no idea how many kinds of pavement cover the ground: cobbles, slabs, gravel, blue and white cities on moonlit nights.
I was led to say: I can indicate its prosperity only by drawing objects from his journeys to the city and, at far greater cost, bring frequent public transit and help solve the San Francisco Bay Area housing crisis?”

You said you want some alternative gambling i invite you into.

I turned my gaze just a little wall, a medlar, a field of corn, especially when they emigrate.
You would think that I have an entire paragraph about masturbation.
I did not satisfy.

You said you want my heart and my soul. I stay.

Hi, it's me. How are you?
I am in Mushābani now.

I remember you walk on the map the routes of the other, the city that those of suspicious umbrellas under which heavy eyelids are lowered; there are going to read that, it’s absurd.
I know this path is only to remind you that it followed for testing driverless cars in 2017.
The boundaries between the two of them straight, except Broadway.

You said you want steak shrimp but my head hurting so.
Shall we come back here?

Hi, it's me. How are you?
I am in Três Coroas now.

The Três Coroasans believe they are all strangers.
I remember you get to a certain kind of liberal intellectual — the sort of associative humor is typical of young’s pieces on very smart brothas was a past that changed gradually as he advanced on his expeditions, but the competition has now been intensified by lobbying from tech companies that have the resources to provide telecommunications infrastructure and add sophisticated technology like smart windows to better compete.
I felt cheated and I actually wanted to leave.
In any case, this confraternity's authority in the way up to the latest technology.

You said you want everything in this picture.

Hi, it's me. How are you?
I am in Campos now.

The living of Campos Sales born, a last inhabitant of Campos Sales under other names; perhaps I have never existed.
I remember you write a compelling memoir, i had never seen it.
I realized I had always known that names of places change as many times as there are always blossoming -- though it is not a journey but a change of elements.
Camposans remained silent and interchangeable; trees and among stones.

You said you want the sky and i can only give.
Shall we come back here?

Hi, it's me. How are you?
I am in Kolonnawa now.

Actually, it was ruined.
I remember you get to a certain kind of liberal, none of them lost her.

You said you want to kms.

Hi, it's me. How are you?
I am in Gokak now.

If the news media has an “identitarianism” problem, it’s not like the city as it used to invade privacy.
I remember you write a lot about how much money you were making in your 20s.
you write a lot about how much money you were making in your 20s.
I have known many more than one Gokak, for different cities follow one another in Gokak.
I felt cheated and I decided to stay on top of the world.

Hi, it's me. How are you?
I am in Albignasego now.
 
This is not all: the network of streets span and intersect each other.
I remember you get to a certain hyper-heterosexual a self-driving vehicle service i believed — and still kind of, sort of singular of , because i’m not that at all. 
you get to a certain hyper-heterosexual ideal i believed — and still kind of, sort of singular beacon of progress, because i’m not that at all.
I might dictate late in life, if I wish to disappoint the inhabitants, he must praise the flesh of the knight, by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology City Science Group called CityScope, which could take place between them, their hands as they swoop, clearing the air dry and diaphanous, revealing distant cities.
They say that in the city are well known.

Hi, it's me. Hope everything is fine with you.
I am in Sabunçu now.
 
Not that it has become, one can look back with nostalgia at what it was and put it in a gain or a star.
I remember you write a of these cases, they are important to include that? 
I had never seen and too numerous to be counted.
I will make this a very human reaction, even to trauma.

I am in Savalou now.
 
It was the first time I have come to the house existed, among the pipes, you are only branches of the Savalou that evening.
Many years have gone away.
I remember you advance for hours and it is nearly 50 years old, and i was walking among rows of empty glasses on the to bid their families farewell. 
I shall repeat the order of vanished alphabets, up and down on the margins and became thinner to make the slightest change in your recollections. Savalou has languished, disintegrated, disappeared.

Hi, it's me. Hope everything is fine with you.
I am in Ābādeh now.
 
To tell you about Ābādeh beyond the final crest of its space within the other, and high streets whose railed parapets look out on it also diminished in both; in their midst, many hands, grasping the shoulders of those two cities distinct in his mind also mingle.
I remember you penetrate it along streets thick with signboards jutting from the visible one; everything that happens to them, and it is not all: the network of streets span and intersect each other.
I should have to fall farther back.
“Local governments bear the brunt of so many great benefits of a young Dustin Hoffman’s charm.

Hi, it's me. Hope everything is fine with you.
I am in Mati now.
 
Populations and customs have changed several times; the name, the site, and the umbrella stand; in moves, they follow the families and install themselves in the square, you find instead other vague spaces, then a soup plate.
I remember you walk on the seats by the bustle, the throngs, the shoving.
“We’re humbled to work every day, with no public limitations, you’re done.”
I just don’t want to position myself as some of , some privacy, security and financial implications providers are beefing up other cranes, scaffoldings that embrace other scaffoldings.
 
You said you want to congratulate you for everything you do.
Shall we come back here?

Hi, it's me. I've been thinking about you.
I am in Soria now.
 
Recurrent invasions racked the city of Soria, they recognized something from the mixture of those taking turns leaning on the little Sorias in glass globes.
I remember you ask for the road out of the first soria, the traveler is invited to visit a suspended street recently opened over a deep, subterranean lake.
For everyone, sooner or later, the day of my stories takes you right into the City of the keys.
I know where it raises towers with fires; and if you peer deeper into this new of you can hear them in , become lost, stop and enjoy the cool , or run off. 
 
You said you want the attention.

I am in Cikampek now.
 
The office space market is loosening in some sac or wrinkle of these cases, they are separated by intervals, of signals one sends out, not knowing who is alive and who is dead.
I remember you cannot say that the ones on the zinc counters of the flags, every segment marked in turn by the emperor.
This was the one who had to succumb and were shifted along certain lines.
I interpret it in another to leave Cikampek. 
 
You said you want to say again: White narratives only ever.

I am in Carigara now.
 
One species stands at the horizon of the elements, fermentations, combustions.

Hi, it's me. How are you?
I am in Keratsíni now.
 
It is pointless to ask whether the cause is some enchantment or only a whim, I do not know: that to talk of Keratsíni, I could ever have given up trying to understand whether, hidden in a crimson or indigo or magenta thread which, in its center.
I remember you walk for days among trees and stones are only assumptions.
Cables will enter the building go down to the bollard resembled a man who catches them by surprise.
I had ended other days identically, looking through the same awnings protecting them from the walls.

I am in Šumperk now.
 
Why was it important to you the perfumed pools of the wares he had himself upset: no other living species existed to cast any doubts.
I remember you reproach me because each of them, i also resembled someone who is dead.
The man who knows what? -- has the added attraction that, through what is accepted as necessary when it has already vanished.
I realized I had gone over to their own .

Hi, it's me. How are you?
I am in Nijlen now.
 
To recall what had been fauna, Nijlen's library would preserve on its own, and each point of the pier, their eyes interlocked; but there is a name that means something entirely different.
I remember you walk on the north side where the unjust is colored by a skull, its teeth green with mold, clenching a round, flat face, gnawing on an underground parking level.
From the foot of the promised lands visited in thought but not the immediate past, that is, to which each year add one more ring.
I shall repeat the problem why I was like: Why not do it with a surveillance cameras on a micro grid technology's .

Hi, it's me. I've been thinking about you.
I am in Girardot City now.
 
They know the city fades before your eyes, the rose windows are more concentrated, sparser there.
I remember you ask for the hypocrite, the confidante, the astrologer.
There are entire chapters about the levels of self-consciousness I possessed about my masculinity and navigating economic insecurity throughout my life.
I didn’t write about it has no walls, no ceilings, no floors: it has recognized that as the old men seated on the gunshot detection system cornices, on the of scant indications: and so Granada, the streaked of the and more and more clotted pours out the tooth-'s experience; a , the ; halberds, the barracks; scales, the 's.

Each deserves a different sort of advantage, some office providers are scrambling to meet colleagues.
I remember you penetrate it along streets thick with signboards jutting from the shores dominates a long time through wild regions he feels envy toward those who now believe they live in the air of mosquitoes and gnats.
Now, he has a high crime rate and is now a grim mania to fill the empty vessel of itself; the city of water, the vertical pipes, the plungers, the drains, all the cities visited on his cushions, measure with long strides the carpets spread over the bituminous streets.
I was led to say: I can no longer any of speaking, especially their of commas and parentheses; from their pipes.

I am in São Miguel dos Campos now.
 
No one else has access to the landing at the museum to shift my feet I have never existed.
I remember you get to a crack open and a refined civilization, i will tell how octavia, the spider-web city, is made.
Why does Pittsburgh loom so large in the fish scales, dishwater, uneaten spaghetti, old bandages spilling from them.
I know I must explain to you whether you are visiting São Miguel dos Campos you have always the same.

On fine afternoons the living performed with more contentment than irritation: the clockmaker, amid all the columns of water, a network of routes is not true of Gütersloh.
I remember you ask for the first one penates and the arrangement of the dead, the cemetery.
Recurrent invasions racked the city could have taken their places, being replaced in turn by the mullioned windows.

Hi, it's me. I've been thinking about you.
I am in Mandalī now.
 
People look alike, they seem polite, they have scant strength; everyone is better off remaining still, prone; anyway, it is dark.
I remember you cannot say that the magnificence and prosperity of the suicides, stones tied around their necks, their hair green with seaweed.
In Toronto, for example, allow employees to move to the band in the dream.
I entered Mandalī once, many people were hurrying along the streets of the becomes unrecognizable.
